# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:

To Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).

## Problem Statement:

1.Identify user pain points. Write 1–2 clear UX problem statements using a defined template: "[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

2.Identifying Appropriate Research Methods Identify the most suitable research methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, usability testing, diary studies). Justify your method choice.

3.Creating Personas Based on previous user data or a given user scenario.

4.Create at least two user personas with: Demographics Goals Behaviors Pain points Motivation Submission:

5.Mention the GitHub Repo URL in the submission text and attach the lab report pdf.

## Output:

## Scenario 1: Designing a Health App for Chronic Disease Management

## 1. Problem Statements

  **Problem Statement 1:**
 "Adults with chronic illnesses need a way to consistently monitor their health metrics because they often forget or struggle to track their progress manually, which results in poor disease management and increased risk of complications."

   **Problem Statement 2:**
 "Caregivers need a way to access and monitor their patient’s health data remotely because they are not always physically present, which results in missed updates and delayed interventions."
 
## 2. Research Methods
User Interviews – To understand daily challenges and emotional factors of managing chronic illnesses.


Diary Studies – To track how users interact with their current solutions over time and identify patterns.


Usability Testing (Prototype Phase) – To evaluate how easily users can navigate and use the health tracking features.


Justification:
 Chronic disease management involves nuanced, long-term behavior. Diary studies provide insights into how users engage with tracking over time. Interviews reveal emotional pain points, while usability testing ensures the final interface supports users intuitively.

## Scenario 2: Designing an E-commerce Website for Local Handicrafts

## 1. Problem Statements

**Problem Statement 1:**
 "First-time online shoppers in rural areas need a way to confidently purchase handicrafts online because they are unfamiliar with digital payment and shipping processes, which results in distrust and abandoned carts."

**Problem Statement 2:**
 "Local artisans need a way to showcase and sell their products digitally because they lack marketing experience, which results in poor visibility and limited sales."

## 2. Research Methods
Surveys – To gather broad quantitative data about user tech literacy and preferences.

Contextual Inquiry – Observe rural users interacting with smartphones and online stores.
